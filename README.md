## Live Demo
A live demo of the app is available on [GitHub Pages](https://bartosz-cz.github.io/React_ViewDataApp/). Note that the live demo does not include the real-time data stream due to limitations on GitHub Pages.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

# Installation and Usage

## Installation
To set up the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/yourgithub/repo.git
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   - Change into the project directory:
     ```sh
     cd repo
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   - Install the necessary npm packages:
     ```sh
     npm install
     ```

## Running the Application
After installing the dependencies, you can run the application using the following command:

```sh
npm start
```
This command will start a local development server and open the application in your default web browser. The server will continue to run, watching for any file changes and automatically refreshing the browser.

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can start exploring its features:

1. **Navigating Through Tabs**
   - The application is organized into multiple tabs, each representing a group of related data metrics. Click on the tabs on the left side of the interface to switch between different groups of data.

2. **Viewing and Interacting with Data**
   - The main area of the interface displays data metrics such as voltage, current, temperature, etc. These metrics are presented in a grid format, with each metric having its own panel.
   - Some panels display real-time data updates, while others show historical data with charts.

3. **Customizing the View**
   - Each panel includes controls for customization:
     - **Chart Type:** Switch between different chart types (e.g., line, bar) depending on how you want to visualize the data.
     - **Zoom:** Use the zoom controls to focus on a specific time range or data point.
     - **Color Schemes:** Adjust the color scheme of the charts to suit your preferences or to enhance readability.
     - **Data Points:** Toggle the visibility of specific data points or lines within a chart to reduce clutter and focus on whatâ€™s important.

4. **Full-Screen Mode**
   - For a more detailed analysis, you can switch individual panels to full-screen mode by clicking the full-screen icon located on each panel.

5. **Live Updates**
   - The application supports live data updates. As new data is received, the charts and data panels will automatically update without the need to refresh the page.

6. **Data Export**
   - If needed, you can export the data from certain panels to a CSV file for further analysis or reporting. Look for the export option within the panel's settings.

7. **Settings and Configuration**
   - Access the settings panel by clicking the gear icon. Here you can configure global application settings such as:
     - Data refresh rate
     - Default chart types
     - Global color schemes
     - Language and localization options

8. **Using the Live Demo**
   - If you're trying out the live demo on GitHub Pages, note that it is a static preview and does not include live data streaming. However, it will give you a good sense of the application's interface and basic functionalities.
